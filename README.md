# Node groups

## Cube Tree

A geometry nodes node group for generating low poly random tree objects. The position of the object is used to calculate a seed value for the random number generator. On top of that there is a separate seed parameter that can be changed to change the appearance of the tree without moving it.

| Parameter          | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tree Height        | (Relative) Height of the  trunk                                                         |
| Trunk resolution   | Defines the number of vertical cuts on the tree trunk                                   |
| Seed               | Additional seed value                                                                   |
| Canopy Dark Color  | The darkest color the canopy can have, applied to the face corners as the vertex color  |
| Canopy Light Color | The lightest color the canopy can have, applied to the face corners as the vertex color |
| Trunk Dark Color   | The darkest color the trunk can have, applied to the face corners as the vertex color   |
| Trunk Light Color  | The lightest color the trunk can have, applied to the face corners as the vertex color  |
| Canopy Material    | Material input used for the canopy                                                      |
| Trunk Material     | Material input used for the trunk                                                       |
